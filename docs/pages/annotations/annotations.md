# Extending Annotations

Annotations are a form of metadata, which are used to provide data about a program that is not part of the program itself. They are a very generic tool and can be used for anything that processes the code before its run. 

The Annotation system in Java is extensible, as you can create your own annotations with their own meanings. You can also tell the compiler where these annotations go.
